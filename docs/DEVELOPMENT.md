# Development

## Toolchain

Aicrew is written in Go. `go.mod` declares `go 1.25.0`, and CI builds and
tests with the latest Go 1.25 patch release. A newer local toolchain works;
keep `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` if you do not want Go to download another toolchain.

The store uses SQLite through `modernc.org/sqlite`, a pure-Go driver. With
CGO disabled the build needs no C compiler and produces a static binary on
Linux, Windows and macOS. Aimem makes the same choice, so both services share
one toolchain and storage engine. The store opens the database in WAL mode
with foreign keys on, full sync, a busy timeout, and write transactions that
take the lock at `BEGIN`, so concurrent commands serialize instead of failing.

## Dependencies

- Every module version is pinned in `go.mod`, and `go.sum` holds the
  checksum of each module in the graph. CI runs `go mod verify` and fails if
  `go mod tidy` would change either file.
- A new dependency or version bump must have been published for at least
  seven days, and its provenance must be checked, before it is merged.
- GitHub Actions are pinned to a commit SHA, with the release tag in a
  comment.

Current direct dependency: `modernc.org/sqlite v1.58.0` (published
2026-09-01, the same version aimem uses).

## Checks

Run these before every push; CI runs the same:

```sh
bash scripts/check-repo.sh     # repository hygiene
gofmt -l .                     # must print nothing
go vet ./...
go mod verify
go mod tidy -diff              # must print nothing
go test -count=1 ./...
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...
```

CI check names: `repo-checks`, `go-lint`, `go-test (ubuntu-latest)`,
`go-test (windows-latest)`, `go-test (macos-latest)`, `go-build`.

## Layout

- `internal/store`: the aicrew coordination store. It is internal and has
  no CLI, MCP or network surface. See the package documentation for the
  rules it enforces.
